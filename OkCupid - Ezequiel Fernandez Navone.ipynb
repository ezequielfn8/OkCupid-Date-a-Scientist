    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, there has been a massive rise in the usage of dating apps to find love. Many of these apps use sophisticated data science techniques to recommend possible matches to users and to optimize the user experience. These apps give us access to a wealth of information that we’ve never had before about how different people experience romance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this portfolio project, I analyzed some data from OkCupid, an app that focuses on using multiple choice and short answers to match users."

    "## Scoping\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, the scope consisted of four steps: project goals, actions and data, analysis, and the evaluation of each step to build conclusions and to communicate findings in a more effective way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Project goals\n",
    "The goal for this project was to perform Data Analysis with Machine Learning techniques on a dataset of OkCupid provided by CodeCademy. I tried to filled null values on key columns with predictive algorithms using Python library Scikit-Learn, and then I moved on to making predictions about the status of potential new users.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Actions and Data\n",
    "The actions that were made to work toward the goal of the project were the analysis and transformation of the dataset provided by CodeCademy.com, called \"Profiles.csv\" and Species_info.csv, to get even insightful information and elaborate Machine Learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Analysis\n",
    "The analysis was conducted on these main questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can I predict the null values for important features of the dataset like a person's diet or religion?\n",
    "- Is there an efficient way to predict the profile status (availability) for potential new users?\n",
    "- Am I able to predict if these people logged in in the last 7 days without looking at that information?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Evaluation\n",
    "Finally, it's a good idea to revisit the goals and check if the output of the analysis corresponds to the questions first set to be answered (in the goals section). This section also reflects on what has been learned through the process, and if any of the questions were unable to be answered. This could also include limitations or if any of the analysis could have been done using different methodologies."
